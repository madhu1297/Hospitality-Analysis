Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.

However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them wif these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.
